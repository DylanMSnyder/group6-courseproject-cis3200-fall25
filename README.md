# Project Narrative
## Ethics of Animal Testing
### Purpose
This site’s goal is to raise awareness of animal testing as well as its downsides/impact on lab animals, as well as its purpose in testing things such as medicine. We aim to highlight the ethics involving testing on animals as well as alternatives to testing on animals.
### Target Audience

 - The general consumer base for the most common products from companies that use animal testing
 - Those unaware of the rampant animal testing in their products
 - Those aware of animal testing but not fully educated on the subject
 
### What is Animal Testing? Why are animals used in research?
Animal testing is the experimentation of new products or medicines using animals as a medium to obtain possible results. This typically involves raising and housing the animal outside of its normal habitat to keep it in a controlled environment and raising it in a specific way to reduce any behavioral changes. Animals are used in research as it is believed that animals can provide a good comparison to how these products and medicines will affect humans if they are used on them. Home Page Blurb Animal testing is the usage of new and untested products meant for consumers to see their effects on living beings before they are used on humans.
 
### Insight into the conditions that these animals are put through
The Animals being used in research are often kept in environments that are highly restrictive, artificial, and stressful. Many animal testing cases explain that “animals in laboratories are often housed in environments that are unnatural and stressful to them, deprived of normal social, physical, and behavioral interactions.” These animals are typically confined to small cages, with limited ability to move, explore, or express natural behaviors such as social bonding, nesting, or foraging. The study notes that these conditions are not just uncomfortable — they are psychologically harmful: “Such conditions cause chronic stress and anxiety, leading to abnormal behaviors like pacing, self-mutilation, and repetitive motions.” Furthermore, many animals endure painful or fatal procedures, as “the majority of animal experiments cause significant pain, distress, or death to the animals involved.” Even when anesthesia is used, recovery periods and repeated testing often leave animals in continuous discomfort. The laboratory setting itself — bright lights, constant noise, human handling, and isolation — creates a state of persistent fear and physiological strain that profoundly shapes their daily experience.

Creating many physically and mentally harmful habits in these animals that result in heavy depression or death.

### Ethics behind animal testing
Animal testing is heavily debated as being unethical due to the conditions that the animals are put under. Some scientists profess that the animals are taken great care of and any uncomfortable situations are kept to the bare minimum. Protesters said that simply keeping hold of the animals is considered unethical let alone testing chemicals. In some cases testing on the animal does cause pain and discomfort in the animal. Outside of the animals themselves the data obtained is even under question. Pro testing says that the data is invaluable to see how it affects humans before reaching human trials while those against it say that the data can be obtained without using animals or simply is not worth it. In 2024, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine polled American adults on the topic of Animal Testing. 85% of American adults felt that Animal Experimentation should be phased out for modern and animal-free methods. Additionally, 80% felt that the Federal Government should commit to a plan to phase out Animal Testing. Home Page Blurb The ethics of animal testing is a conversation that needs to be had whether you are for it or against it simply due to the fact that there are merits on both sides. In the end none can deny that at the cost of an animal's feral life human lives have been saved.
